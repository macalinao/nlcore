NLTweaks
========

Contains all of the small tweaks to gameplay New Liberty has to offer.

## What is a Tweak?
A tweak is a single class file that is too small to be a plugin, but still needs to be added in.
It's hard to manage a lot of JARs, so Ian decided that it would be best to merge all the smaller plugins into one.
